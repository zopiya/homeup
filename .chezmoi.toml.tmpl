    # --- SSH FIDO2 Keys (YubiKey Hardware Tokens) ---
    # Format: "key::<algorithm> <public_key_data> <comment>"
    # The "key::" prefix enables Git's literal key format (supports agent forwarding)
    #
    # How to Get Your Keys:
    #   1. List SSH public keys: ssh-add -L
    #   2. Or read from file: cat ~/.ssh/main-ssh.zopiya.com.pub
    #   3. Copy entire line (including algorithm and comment)
    #   4. Add "key::" prefix for Git config compatibility
    #
    # Key Format Breakdown:
    #   - sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com: Algorithm (FIDO2 security key)
    #   - AAAA....: Base64-encoded public key data
    #   - main-ssh.zopiya.com: Comment (identifies the key)
    #
    # Security Notes:
    #   - Public keys only (safe to commit to Git)
    #   - Private keys stay on YubiKey (never leave hardware)
    #   - Both keys uploaded to GitHub/GitLab for verification

    # Main YubiKey (primary signing key - currently active)
    signingkey = "key::sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com AAAAGnNrLXNzaC1lZDI1NTE5QG9wZW5zc2guY29tAAAAIGctlOG1aZMZJi5NKHALQArMupDYKxiYudxWUhbJiW3xAAAAF3NzaDptYWluLXNzaC56b3BpeWEuY29t"

    # Backup YubiKey (alternate signing key - for emergencies)
    # Both keys are always trusted in ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
    # To switch: Edit ~/.config/git/config and swap the active signingkey
    backupsigningkey = "key::sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com AAAAGnNrLXNzaC1lZDI1NTE5QG9wZW5zc2guY29tAAAAIGIsrImiTnp+s3cwf9Jj5sruHq2C8xSgfWNO9qMDAcRaAAAAF3NzaDpiYWNrLXNzaC56b3BpeWEuY29t"

    # --- Profile Selection ---
    # Controls which dotfiles are deployed and how tools are configured
    # Profiles:
    #   - macos: Trust anchor with local YubiKeys, full tooling, agent forwarding
    #   - linux: Zero trust remote server, no local keys, minimal tools
    #   - mini:  Borrowed environment (containers, VMs), agent forwarding from host
    #
    # Default: mini (safest for unknown environments)
    # Override: export HOMEUP_PROFILE=macos && chezmoi apply
